	<Bible Title="Hebrews 4:" Verse="16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 5:" Verse="1 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 5:" Verse="2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity." />

	<Bible Title="Hebrews 5:" Verse="11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 5:" Verse="12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 5:" Verse="13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 5:" Verse="14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God," />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="2 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="3 And this will we do, if God permit." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="4 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost," />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="5 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come," />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="6 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="7 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="8 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself," />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="19 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 6:" Verse="20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="1 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="2 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="4 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest," />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 7:" Verse="28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="6 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="8 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="9 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="12 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 8:" Verse="13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people," />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these." />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:" />
	<Bible Title="Hebrews 9:" Verse="25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;" />
